\wt{54}
(1) The intersection of any family of closed sets is closed.
(2) The union of finitely many closed sets is closed.
\wpr{55} The union of infinitely many closed sets
is not necessarily closed.
\we{57} The union of the set of elements of a convergent sequence
and its limit is closed. $\{x_n : n \in \N\} \cup \{x\}$.
(Through showing its complement open.)
\wt{58} A subset $F$ of a metric space is closed iff
the limit of every conv. seq. of elements of $F$ is in $F$.
\wde{60 Closure} $(X,d)$ MS, $A \subseteq X$.
The closure of $A$ is the smallest closed set $\overline{A}$ containing $A$.
There is at least one closed set containing $A$,
namely $X$.
The smallest closed subset of $X$ containing $A$ is
$\overling{A} = \bigcap_{A \subseteq F \subseteq X, F \text{ closed}} F$.
\wt{61} Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space, and $A, B \subseteq X$. Then:
(1) $\overline{\emptyset} = \emptyset$ and $\overline{X} = X$.
(2) $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ and $\overline{A}$ closed.
(3) $A$ is closed iff $A = \overline{A}$.
(4) $\overline{\overline{A}} = \overline{A}$.
(5) If $A \subseteq B$, then $\overline{A} \subseteq \overline{B}$.
(6) $\overline{A \cup B} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$.
IMPORTANT: The closure of an open ball is not always equal to the closed ball.
Counterex: discrete metric space, and $[0,1] \cup \{2\}$ with $c=1, r=1$.
\wde{66 Dense} $(X,d)$ MS, $D \subseteq X$ dense iff $\overline{D} = X$.
\wt{68 Adherent Point} $(X,d)$ MS, $A \subseteq X$, $x \in X$. TFAE
(1) $x$ is an adherent point of $A$.
(2) $x \in \overline{A}$.
(3) $\forall r > 0, B(x, r) \cap A \neq \emptyset$.
(4) There exists a sequence $(a_n)_{n \in \N}$ in $A$ s.t. $a_n \to x$.
