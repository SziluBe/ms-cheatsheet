\we{36} Cauchy seq. with a convergent subseq. is convergent.
\wde{38 Complete Metric Space} iff every Cauchy sequence converges.
\wde{40 Open Sets and Closed Sets}
$(X,d)$ MS, $G \subseteq X$.
(1) $G$ is open iff $\forall x \in G, \exists \epsilon > 0, B(x,\epsilon) \subseteq G$.
(2) $G$ is closed iff $G^C$ is open.
\we{42} Every open ball is an open set.
\wde{45 Discrete metric space} iff all its subsets are open,
iff all its subsets are closed.
\wde{49 Clopen} iff open and closed.
\we{41} $X$ and $\emptyset$ are clopen in any MS $(X, d)$.
\we{43} Under the discrete metric every subset is clopen.
\wt{50}
(1) The union of any family of open sets is open.
(2) The intersection of finitely many open sets is open.
\wpr{51} The intersection of infinitely many open sets
is not necessarily open.
\we{52 Relatively open subsets} $(X, d)$ MS, $\emptyset \neq A \subseteq X$,
equipped with the induced metric $d_A$.
Let $G \subseteq A$.
Then $G$ is open in $(A, d_A)$ iff
$\exists O \subseteq X$ open in $(X,d)$ s.t. $G = O \cap A$.
\wt{53 Open Sets and Convergence}
$(X,d)$ MS, $(x_n)_{n \in \N}$ a sequence in $X$, $x \in X$.
Then $(x_n) \to x$ iff every open set that contains $x$
contains all but finitely many $x_n$.
