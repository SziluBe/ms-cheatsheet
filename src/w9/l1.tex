\wde{Connectedness equivalence relation} $(X, d)$ MS,
Define an eq. rel. $\sim$ on $X$ by $x \sim y$ iff $\exists$ connected subset $C \subseteq X$ s.t. $x,y \in C$.
\we{211} If $(C_i)_{i \in I}$ is a family of connected subsets of $X$
with non-empty intersection, then $\bigcup_{i \in I} C_i$ is connected.
\wt{212 Connected components} The eq. class. of $x \in X$ is the largest connected subset of $X$ that contains $x$.
These are the connected components of $X$. They are disjoint.
\wde{213 Path-connected}
$(X, d)$ MS, $x_0, x_1 \in X$.
A path in $X$ from $x_0$ to $x_1$ is a cont. func.
$\gamma: [0,1] \to X$ s.t. $\gamma(0)=x_0$ and $\gamma(1)=x_1$.
$(X,d)$ MS, path-connected iff for any two points in $X$ there is a path in $X$ between them.
A non-empty subset $A \subseteq X$ is said to be path-connected iff the induced MS is path-connected.
\wt{214 Path-connected implies connected}
\we{215/216 Topologist's sine curve}
Connectedness does not imply path-connectedness.
In $\R^2$ with the Euclidian metric, let $A = (0,0) \cup \Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is the graph of
$f: (0, +\infty) \to \R, f(x) = \sin(\frac{1}{x})$.
Then $A$ is connected but not path-connected.
